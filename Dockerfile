# Integration image.

# Gladys sandbox constraints ("the sandbox is the defense"):
#   - rootfs mounted READ-ONLY -> never write outside /data
#   - a single writable volume: /data
#   - runs as a non-root user
#   - multi-arch image (linux/amd64 + linux/arm64), see the build workflow
#
# Nothing but Node.js: the cameras are reached over HTTP with the built-in
# fetch, and the snapshots are resized in pure JavaScript (jpeg-js).
